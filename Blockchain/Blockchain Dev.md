Types of webs:
1. Web1 : Permissionless open sourced web with static content
2. Web2 : Permissioned web, dynamic content, companies run agreements on their servers
3. Web3:  Permissionless web, dynamic content, Decentralized censorship resistant run your agreement and code.

Web3:
1. User owned ecosystem (generally)

The Oracle Problem:
	Blockchains themselves can't access external data.

Blockchain Oracle:
	Devices that interact with off-chain to provide external data or computation to [[Smart Contracts]]

You can't just use single oracle node to feed blockchains with data. You need it to be decentralized too (why? find out).

Decentralized On-Chain + Decentralized Off-Chain (Oracle) = Hybrid Smart Contracts

Chainlink, decentralized oracle network. (Blockchain agnostic)

Most blockchains are compatible with Ethereum smart contracts

Benefits : 
1. Decentralized (no counterparties, thirdparties, centralized forces, etc.)
2. Transparency & flexibility
3. Speed & efficiency
4. Security & immutable

Transparent != No privacy
	Blockchain is pseudo anonymous. Meaning, not really tied to real life identity.
