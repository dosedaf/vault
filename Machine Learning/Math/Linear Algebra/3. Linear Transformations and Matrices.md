	The idea of linear transformations and its relation to matrices
Key :
1. Does not rely on memorization
2. The needs of basis vectors to tell where a vector wild land

Transformation:
	Takes an input -> Spits output (vector)

Algebra limits itself to a special transformation, linear transformations

A transformation is linear if 
1. Lines remain lines (without getting curved, even the diagonal ones)
2. Origin remain fixed

Keeping grid lines parallel and evenly spaced

What formula if you input a vector and it will tell you where the vector lands?
**va -> ? -> vb**

It only needs the basis vectors, i-hat and j-hat

The scalars remain the same btw both being -1 and 2 (consequences of grid lines remain parallel and evenly spaced)

The formula:

It is common to package these coordinates into "2x2 Matrix"
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$
ac being where i-hat lands and bd being where j-hat lands, so in above case
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 3 \\
-2 & 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$
For example:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
3 & 2 \\
-2 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
5 \\
7
\end{bmatrix}
=
5 \begin{bmatrix}
3 \\
-2
\end{bmatrix}
+
7 \begin{bmatrix}
2 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
15 \\
-10
\end{bmatrix}
+
\begin{bmatrix}
14 \\
7
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
29 \\
-3
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Linear transformations are way to move around space such that grid lines remain parallel and evenly spaced, and origin remains fixed

Multiplying a matrix by a vector is that it means computationally to apply that transformation to that vector.
