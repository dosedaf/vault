Vector
	Arrow in a coordinated system (xy-plane), with it's tail sitting at origin.

Basis vectors:
	i (i-hat) : unit vector in the x direction.
	j (j-hat) : unit vector in the y direction.

Linear Combination :
	Product of two vectors that are scaled and added.
	
Why does line have anything to do with this? 
	If you fix one of the scalars and let the other one change it's value freely, the tip of the resulting vector draws a straight line.

	Whilst if you let both scalars range freely and consider every possible vector that you can get. There will be 3 results (or Span) :
		1. You will be able to reach every possible point in the plane..
		2. A single line passing through the origin (if both vectors lined up)
		3. Stuck in the origin (both vectors are 0)

Span:
	Set of all their (vectors's) linear combinations.

Vectors vs Points
	There will be time where collection of vectors is too crowded.
	Vector on it's own -> **Arrow**
	Collection of vectors -> **Points**

Linearly Dependent:
	A vector is not adding anything to the span.

Technical definition of Basis:
	The basis of a vector space is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the full space.
	Meaning: 1 less vector and it won't be a basis. Why? because missing 1 vector will reduce the span. Thus impossible to reach the full space

Linear Algebra limits itself to a special type of transformation, Linear transformations.

A transformation is linear if it has 2 properties:
1. Lines remain lines (also diagonal)
2. Origin remain fixed

Parallel, and evenly spaced
