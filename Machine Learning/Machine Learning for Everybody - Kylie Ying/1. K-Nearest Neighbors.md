### What
	Non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, uses proximity, to classify or predict about the grouping of individual data point
### Mostly used for classification though can be used for regression
Class label is assigned based on majority vote (technically plurality voting since it can be more than 2 classes)
### Requirements:
1. Determine distance metrics
#### Distance Measures
1. Euclidian distance (p=2)
	Most commonly used. Limited to real value vectors. Measures a straight line between query point and the other point being measured

2. Manhattan distance (p=1) Other names: Taxicab, City Block
	Popular distance metrics. Measures the absolute value between two points. Commonly visualized with a grid 
	![[EuclideanDistance.png]]
3. Minkowski distance
	Generalized from Euclidian and Manhattan. p in the formula allows for the creation of other distance metrics. 
	p=2 -> Euclidian
	p=1 -> Manhattan

4. Hamming distance. Other name: Overlap metric
	Typically used with Boolean or string vectors. identifying points where vectors don't match.
