Supervised learning -> Train models and learn output from **labeled** data
Unsupervised learning  -> Find patterns in **unlabeled** data
Reinforcement learning -> Interactive environment (rewards and penalties)

Supervised Learning
Machine learning

input -> model -> output (prediction)
inputs (feature vector)

Features
1. Qualitative 
	A. Categorical (nominal)
		No inherent order. Examples: gender, nationality. der
		Uses one hot encoding
		Data = [USA, France, India, Indonesia]
			USA = [1, 0, 0, 0]
			France = [0, 1, 0, 0]
			India = [0, 0, 1, 0]
			Indonesia = [0, 0, 0, 1]
