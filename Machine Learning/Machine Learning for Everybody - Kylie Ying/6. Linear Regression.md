Residual formula
![[Pasted image 20250806162532.png]]

sum of squared residuals : adds higher penalty from how far off we are from the points that are further of 

Goal: try to find line of best fit that will help decrease the measure of error, with respect to all data points that we have in our data set, and try to come up with the best prediction

#### Assumptions: 
1. Linearity -> Follow linear trajectory
2. Independence -> Each data points don't have influence to one another, All samples are independence
3. Normality
4. Homoskedasticity

#### Evaluating Linear Regression Model
1. Mean Absolute Error
2. Mean Squared Error
3. Root Mean Squared Error

Keywords: 
1. Line of best fit
2. Eyeball
3. Residual/error
