1. P(Ck) : Prior probability -> Do we play soccer or not?
2. P(X) : Predictor variables probabilities (Evidence) -> How much wind is there? What day of the week?
3. P(X | Ck): Likelihood  (Conditional Probability) -> 
4. P(Ck | X): Posterior

Creating new posterior probability build upon the prior by using some sort of evidence

## Bayes Rule

#### "How do we use this to make a classification?"


Keywords:
1. Independent (Assuming each features are all independent)

Questions:
1. Why the number covered in square does not impact the posterior? 
	-  Constant (Same for every classes) ![[Pasted image 20250805105010.png]]
