Complete stack of ideas, protocols, incentives that enable a distributed set of nodes to agree on the state of a blockchain

Reaching consensus -> 66% of the nodes agree on the global state of the network

Ethereum uses [[Proof-of-stake]]-based consensus mechanism.

There's a protocol that governs how honest validators to propose or validate blocks, process transactions and vote for their view of the head of the chain

#### Fork-choice mechanism
Multiple blocks are in the same position near the head of the chain, it will select blocks that make up the heaviest chain, measured by the number of validators that voted for the blocks weighted by ether balance.

#### Types of Consensus Mechanism
- [[Proof-of-work]] based
